# Unraid-Lilygo-T5-Display-Dashboard (E-Paper Server Monitor)
A minimalist e-paper dashboard powered by an ESP32 that displays real-time server stats from an Unraid system, including CPU, RAM, temperature, disk usage, and uptime. Data is sent via a local network using curl, and the display refreshes partially to minimize ghosting, ideal for low-power, always-on status monitoring.
